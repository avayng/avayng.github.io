        <p>Unnoticed is a project that uses a set of nine images taken on the campus of the University of San Francisco that showcases some of the unnoticed beauty that is weaved within it. It’s so easy to get caught up in day to day obligations, and even easier to miss a lot of what is right in front of you; these images admire what has been in plain sight.</p>
