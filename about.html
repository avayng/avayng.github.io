       <p> Hello! My name is Ava Lang and I am a designer based in San Francisco. Being born and raised in Southern California has largely influenced me to think of how I can make work sustainably and ethically. I love graphic and print design, and in my free time I enjoy collaging, taking pictures, and editing videos. I am currently a sophomore at the University of San Francisco, working towards completing my major in Design and minor in English. I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2026, and would love to work in product/packaging design, making cover art, or working in the fashion industry. I aspire to work somewhere that sees the importance in an environment centered on community, as I feel that will translate to the quality of work and goals behind them.  </p>
